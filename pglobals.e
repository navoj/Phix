-- A note on S_Const and S_Init:
-- ============================
--
--  On a variable, S_Init is a used to hold a -1 terminated chain of assigned
--  items, or 0 when the assignment state is unknown. On fixed string and sequence
--  S_Const entries it is in fact a (non-zero) ttidx, rather than 1. More details
--  can be found in pmain.e/DoSequence(), which represents string and subsequence 
--  elements using {-ttidx} and {ttidx} respectively; psym.e/AddUnnamedConstant() 
--  and (eg) pttree.e/tt_sequence() also contain relevant code and comments. The
--  rest of this section focuses on the zero and non-zero differences.
--
--  On a normal variable, S_Init is set non-0 at assignment (/use) and cleared
--   at some following end if/end procedure etc, and so indicates whether the 
--   variable is assigned at the current location in the code, whereas on a 
--   constant, S_Init is (no surprise here) set once and never amended again.
--   Note there is no setting of S_Init (on anything) to indicate unassigned.
--   On a normal var a non-zero S_Init means it definitely contains something
--   valid, whereas zero means it may or may not contain something.
--
--  constant ZERO=0 creates an S_Const with S_Init set, so that eg "=ZERO" can 
--    be translated to "cmp reg,0" (and perhaps more importantly there is no
--    point ever wasting a precious register by loading ZERO into it), whereas
--  constant Main=create(Window,...) leaves S_Init zero, indicating that the 
--    value is not known until runtime, hence "=Main" must (with some poetic 
--    licence) be translated to "cmp reg,[Main]".
--  In fact, of course, Main /will/ be assigned by the time any code references
--    it, and hence any non-S_Init S_Const should be treated as an init var.
--    It is worth taking a moment to fully digest that last point.
--
--  Thus S_Init has a completely different meaning on S_Const entries.
--
-- S_Nlink:
-- ========
--  This chain is for all symtab entries with the same name, eg:
--
--      p0.exw:
--      integer fred                                    -- [1]
--      include i1.e
--          i1.e:
--          global procedure fred() ?9/0 end procedure  -- [2]
--          include i2.e:
--              integer fred                            -- [3]
--              procedure x()
--                  for fred=1 to 10 do                 -- [4]
--
-- Inside the for loop, there will be no less than four symtab entries on
--  the S_Nlink chain, which starts in some tt[ttidx+EQ], and is resolved
--  without problem by the scope rules. At the end for, and eof of i2/p0,
--  one entry is delinked, so by the time we reach pemit.e (ie at the end
--  of compilation, after all source files are processed), only 1 remains.
--  At that point, for bind at least, the other 3 (locals) are put back 
--  onto the chain (see relink() in pttree.e, to facilitate this [S_Nlink] 
--  is set to -2 at delink) so that the .exe contains just one name "fred" 
--  referenced from 4 symtab entries (so it can write a readable ex.err).
--
--  S_Nlink is also used to keep a list of temporary (unnamed) vars, see
--  newTempVar() in psym.e and freeTempVar() in pmain.e - technically of
--  course these also all have the same name (-1). (There is probably no 
--  particular reason why S_Slink could not be used for that instead.)
--
-- S_Slink:
-- ========
--  This is the scope or secondary chain. It begins life as a pure scope
--  chain, for delinking all symtab entries off the S_Nlink chain at the
--  places mentioned above, eg at eof of i2.e we start at a localscopeX
--  and follow the S_Slink chain to unlink i2.e's locals.
--  Later on it has four other purposes:
--  *   Final var-idx for S_Const and S_Gvar entries is stored here,
--      see the start[DEV] of finalfixups() in pemit.e.
--  *   The "routine_to_do_list" for pemit.e is built in S_Slink, see
--      finalfixups() and scanforShortJmp() in pemit.e.
--  *   Namespaces are linked together in pemit.e - while compile-time
--      resolution occurs using the normal tt[ttidx+EQ]/S_Nlink chain,
--      run-time resolution uses S_Slink, see builtins/prtnid.e
--  *   S_TVar entries are linked together for debug/diag purposes at
--      the start of pemit.e (DEV but ain't it already so??)
--
-- S_Clink:
-- ========
--  This is a special link for S_Const entries with the same value.
--  Clearly if we use the constant value "hello" five times in a
--  program, ideally we only write one copy of it to the .exe, with
--  a reference count of 5 as needed. Take for example the following
--  code fragment:
--      puts(1,"hello")
--      constant hello="hello",
--               hello2="hello"
--  The first line creates an unnamed constant; the second line can
--  "hijack" this and put a name on that symtab entry, however the
--  third line needs another symtab entry. So in that particular case
--  there would be one "hello" in the .exe with a reference count of
--  two, and two symtab entries for it, even though we actually used
--  the value three times in the source code. For more details, refer
--  to addUnnamedConstant() in psym.e, DoConstant() in pmain.e, and
--  (eg) DumpString() in pemit.e.
--
--  There are two rules for S_Clink:
--    * The first ever entry always remains the first. This is to
--      prevent eg:
--          puts(1,<something>)
--          constant AnOtherOne=1
--          puts(1,<something else>)
--      from using T_Const1 on the first puts but AnOtherOne on the
--      second puts, which would make list.asm/debugging confusing.
--      (They might both use AnOtherOne, at least it's consistent.)
--      However there is no requirement for any other ordering, so
--      typically we might expect the S_Clink chain to be:
--          first,last,last-but-one,...,third,second.
--    * While as above there may be Named and Unnamed constants, in
--      practice something like constant hello="hello" first creates
--      an unnamed constant (within Factor()) and then "hijacks" it
--      (within DoConstant()), and in fact if an Unnamed entry exists,
--      (ie [S_State]=-1) it will *always* be the _first and *only*_
--      entry on the S_Clink chain, since any futher occurrences use
--      any(/the first) existing Named entry. This means we never 
--      have to go looking for an Unnamed entry, and by that I mean 
--      at any point where we might want to re-use/slap a name on it.
--
--  S_Clink may one day be changed from 9 to 10 so that there is a
--  (positive) S_Tidx entry on S_Const and S_Gvar. [DEV/see S_Slink]
--
-- S_vtype:
-- ========
--  For builtin types, this is 1..15, see T_integer..T_object below,
--   and/or psym.e/syminit(). Note these are carefully arranged as a
--   bit-pattern so that or_bits/and_bits/not_bits can be used on them.
--  For user defined types, this is the routine no of the type check
--   routine, typically say 385..20,000. Use rootType() to discover
--   the underlying builtin type.
--
--  T_N is a dummy internal type, meaning "float but not integer".
--  This is not available for application coders for a number of
--  somewhat obsure reasons, including but not limited to:
--      3.0 (for example) is stored as the integer 3 for performance,
--          eg find(3,blah) does not have to check for 3 or 3.0, and
--          "if f=3" can just cmp rather than cmp/fld/fcomp/fnstsw.
--      1.5+1.5 ought to type check if stored in a T_N variable.
--  Likewise other dummy internal types are not available since they
--   would cause far more confusion than be of any help.
--
-- S_value:
-- ========
--  Mainly of use on S_Const entries, as S_nFno on namespaces (erm?), 
--  and not present/as S_sig on routine entries.
--  Note that when binding this contains the "seq_tree"'d version of
--  sequence constants, ie {-tidx} for string elements and {tidx} for
--  subsequences, to optimise the output - see DumpSequence in pemit.e
--  When interpreting, [S_value] contains the "proper" value.
--
-- S_nFno:
-- =======
--  Just to be absolutely clear on this, S_FPno is the file it is defined
--  in, and S_nFno is the file it refers to. Suppose main.exw (file 1) is
--
--      integer L
--      include win32lib.ew as w32
--
--  such that win32lib.ew is file 2, then w32 has the same S_FPno as L
--  (ie both L and w32 are locals "owned" by file 1) and the S_nFno on
--  the w32 symtab (/namespace) entry is 2. Hence "w32:X" means first 
--  look for a (local) namespace in currFile(1), ie the "w32" part, then 
--  go look for a global "X" defined (or [indirectly] included) by the
--  file indicated by that namespace's S_nFno(2). All dreadfully simple,
--  but sometimes it is all too easy to get confused by this, when playing
--  with the compiler innards, that is.
--  [Be advised that pdiag.e etc usually means win32lib.ew is > file 2.]
--
-- =======
--
--  S_ErrV, S_Init, S_Efct, and S_ErrR entries are discarded when writing a .exe.
--
--  S_ErrV just holds a line number for unused/not assigned etc messages, which
--          are emitted from unused_cleanup() in pilx86.e.
--          Note that after that point, the slot is resued for S_ConstChain:
--
--  S_ConstChain holds a chain of constant refs and recounts which must be fixed
--          up after the data segment has been completed. For instance, suppose
--          you have the call:
--              someproc(somestring,"fred")
--          The somestring /variable/ must be loaded and increfed eg as follows:
--              mov ecx,[somestring]    -- load
--              mov [param1],ecx        -- store
--              inc [ebx+ecx*4-8]       -- incref   (AGI stall occurs here ;-(()
--          (with some poetic licence, for instance we might call opMove,
--           to check for unassigned src or to deallocate the target, etc,
--           but the basics are all pretty much the same whatever we use.)
--DEV newEmit: we cannot relocate refs so no [in DLLs] (but refcounts are fine)
--          However: doing the same thing for a constant is silly considering
--          we know (or will) exactly what the ref is, so there should be no
--          need to load it, and we also know exactly where the refcount is 
--          or will be stored, so we can use a literal address and avoid that
--          AGI stall. Unfortunately, even by the time we "finalise" the x86
--          (in scanforShortJmp/blurph in pemit.e), we still do not know the
--          final address. S_ConstChain is zeroed in unused_cleanup() for 
--          S_Const entries and then keeps a linked list of places that need 
--          to be fixed up in the x86 binary, once we have decided exactly 
--          where the constant will live. isConstRef and isConstRefCount are
--          used to mark these things. As S_ErrV use ends in unused_cleanup,
--          S_ConstChain can reuse that slot in the symbol table.
--

-- K_used bit:
--      [do not confuse K_used with S_used; K_used should definitely be called      [DEV]
--       something else, but I cannot think of anything appropriate off hand..]
--       (how about K_param(=#10) and K_rlink(=#40)... [DEV])
--  This now has several meanings.
--      On a Tvar, it indicates the variable is a routine parameter. If a normal
--      variable is set but not used, no matter, eg void=xxx(), whereas for params 
--      (which are set whenever there is a call), you should get an unused warning.
--      On a routine, it initially indicates a top-level-sub, and is later used to 
--      link up all reachable routines during the bind phase.
--  Used in pmain.e (once), psym.e (once), pgscan(four times), and pemit.e (lots).
--  UPDATE: 05/07/2013. Also used in pmain.e/Assignment, when assigning a literal
--          on declaration. Bit of a fudge but it seems to work perfectly, plus I
--          have been trying for ages to think of a way to get a suitable warning
--          message ("x is unused") for eg "sequence x = {}", without things like
--          Main = create(Window...) throwing similar when clearly not wanted (ie
--          when symtab[N][S_State] does not end up with S_Used [nb yes S_] set).

--      BTW, The internal types "float" and "dword_sequence" are

--      would crash with typecheck error (we store 3.0 as integer 3,

--      the first assigment is OK, but the second would also crash
--      with a typecheck error since it is equivalent to DS="GHI".
--      It is the compiler's job to figure out when sequence/atom
--      really mean T_Dsq/T_N, rather than down to the programmer.
--
--      To be pedantic, I suppose T_string should really have been 4
--      and T_Dsq 8 (T_sequence unchanged) but it makes no difference

--newEBP (this is all now gibberish [aka a wee bit out of date]:)
--  Phix uses a doubly-linked chain of "virtual stack blocks" (8K each)
--   instead of using the system stack:
--
--              0
--              ^
--               vsb
--              ^   V
--      ebp-->   vsb
--              ^   V
--               vsb
--                  0
--
--  While traditional languages use [ebp+/-nn] to locate local variables, and 
--  obviously fixed addresses for global/file-level variables and constants, 
--  Phix always uses fixed addresses, with opFrame saving locals in a vsb and 
--  opRetf restoring them. (Admittedly the [ebp+/-nn] approach might have made
--  Phix programs a bit smaller and faster, but the "one size fits all" method 
--  has the great advantage of being simpler.)
--
--  Now, Phix is written in Phix, and in "p p test" aka "p.exe p.exw test.exw",
--  this is all going on for p.exe, p.exw, and test.exw, ie there are not just
--  one but three completely independent vsb chains.
--
--  In particular, there are call_backs in both pdebug.e (the trace screen) and
--  pdiag.e (the code that creates ex.err files after an error). Further, the
--  compiler "re-uses" the pdiag.e compiled into p.exe when interpreting, rather
--  than load fresh copies for p.exw and test.exw. Application code will usually 
--  execute its mainstream and call_back code all in the same vsb chain, but I'm 
--  sure there could be similar cases there too.
--
--  When a bug occurs, we need to call pdiag.e, which needs to operate on/in the 
--  lowest of the three vsb chains, no matter what level the bug occured at.
--
--  When tracing "p test" (btw there is no claim that eg "p p test" will trace 
--  anything other than p.exw, and may in fact crash if it encounters trace(1) 
--  etc in test.exw), then it must alternate between executing test.exw and 
--  pdebug.e, in different vsb chains.
--
--  Of course, when executing normally the CPU register ebp is enough, but when
--  any call_back is invoked you must switch to the right chain.
--
--  FYI, every vsb block, as pointed to by ebp, carries a pointer to symtab, 
--       which contains an ebp. One hop round this circular loop would, if it
--       were ever needed, map "any old ebp" to the current live value.
--
--  NB: symtab[T_edb] is a 32-bit value, neither a Phix integer nor a Phix atom,    [DEV no such thing any more]
--      and should not be referred to by hll code in any way, that is after
--      retrieving symtab with opGetST (see pops.e, and prtnid.e is probably the 
--      most obvious of several examples in the builtins directory).
