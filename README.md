Phix Programming Language

This is a copy of Pete Lomax's latest version of the Phix programming language. I wanted to post it here on Github because his download server choices might scare people away from trying out the language. So here it is in all it's glory, and maybe people will want to try to convince Pete to host his code in a more conventional place.
