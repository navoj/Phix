--BUGFIX: This compiles cleanly, but when you "include t54inc.exw" that does not....
--        ie: an extra level of include broke t54inca.e (see t55incinc.exw)
--        Caused by opApnd allowing gLen to be reset from -2 (any) to -1 (unknown).
--        The extra include made
--              paramNames={}
--        and
--              paramNames = append(paramNames,0)
--        be processed by ilxlate() in the opposite order.
