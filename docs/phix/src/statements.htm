      <h1 class="title">Statements</h1>
      <div id="mainSection">
         The following kinds of executable statements are available:
        <ul>
         <li>
          <a href="assignment.htm">assignment statement</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="callproc.htm">procedure call</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="if.htm">if statement</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="while.htm">while statement</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="for.htm">for statement</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="return.htm">return statement</a>
         </li>
         <li>
          <a href="exit.htm">exit statement</a>
         </li>
        </ul>
        Semicolons are not required in phix, but can optionally be used to explicitly
        terminate statements. This can be helpful when translating code, or after being
        paid to write C++ all day, you suddenly realise your fingers are automatically 
        adding semicolons at the end of every line.
      <br>  
      <br>  
        Even without semicolons, you are free to put as many statements as you like on 
        one line, or to split a single statement across several lines. However you may 
        not split a statement, with either a semicolon or newline, in the middle of an 
        identifier, string, number or keyword.
      <br>
      <br>
        There is no need for any line continuation syntax, except when splitting very 
        long strings (not using <a href="Strings.htm#triple">triple quotes or 
        backticks</a>) over several lines, which requires a <a href="concatenation.htm">
        concatenation operator ('&')</a>.
