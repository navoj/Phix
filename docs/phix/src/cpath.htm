            In Phix this is just a simple wrapper for <a href="get_proper_path.htm">get_proper_path</a>,
            which is defined in builtins\pgetpath.e (as is canonical_path). The two optional parameters 
            are only present for compatibility with OpenEuphoria, see technicalia for details, and in
            almost all cases should simply be omitted.
            <br>

            Typically canonical_path() should only be required where you are going to compare/sort the
            resulting full paths. In theory a statement such as fn = open(canonical_path(path)) should
            work exactly the same and offer no benefits over the simpler fn = open(path).

            The canonical_path(file,,CORRECT) form, which is equivalent to canonical_path(file,0,CORRECT), 
            can simply be replaced (afaik) with canonical_path(file).
            <br>
            <br>
            The is_directory parameter is ignored. The Phix implementation determines whether path_in is
            a directory or file by looking on the disk and does not need to be told.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Phix version only accepts CORRECT (defined as 2 in psym.e) as a valid setting for case_flags. 
            The OpenEuphoria version allows other flags: AS_IS, TO_LOWER, and TO_SHORT, none of which are
            defined or supported by Phix. AS_IS makes little to no sense: if you are going to preserve the
            wrong case of src when something more accurate is on offer, my warped logic suggests you would
            want res = randomise_case(current_dir())&src to occur when src is not a full path... Likewise,
            TO_LOWER is semi-pointless: either res = lower(canonical_path(src)), or just res = lower(src),
            or the TO_LOWER+CORRECT form (in which existing parts of the path are given correct case and 
            the rest lower) is just simply res = canonical_path(lower(src)). Finally, TO_SHORT is just 
            something I actively want to avoid: while technically they may still exist 8,3 filenames 
            should <i>long</i> be forgotten about by now.
            <br>
            <br>
            The latest OpenEuphoria version appears to have extensive additions for Windows Vista (eg lower
            case drive letters, since rescinded), and other unix/case-insensitive filesystem/enhanced dir() 
            features that I would stand no chance of adequately testing, plus the warning in the OpenEuphoria
            documentation "Does not (yet) handle UNC paths or unix links" persuades me against investing any 
            significant effort here, just yet.
            <br>
            <br>
            The OpenEuphoria version replaces a leading tilde ('~') with $HOME on Unix platforms and
            %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in Windows. Phix does not (yet) support this and were such handling added, 
            I should hope it would apply equally to open(), dir(), <a href="chdir.htm">chdir</a>(), etc.
