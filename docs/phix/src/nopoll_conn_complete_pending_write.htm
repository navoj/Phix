            Complete last pending write process that may be pending from a previous uncompleted write operation.

            <br>
            The function returns the number of bytes that were written.
            <br>
            <br>
            conn: The connection where the pending write operation operation will take place. <br>
            In the case conn == NULL is received, 0 is returned. Keep in mind this.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: In the case no pending write is in place, the function returns 0. <br>
            Otherwise, the function returns the pending bytes that were written. <br>
            The function returns -1 in the case of failure.<br>
            You can call this function as many times as you want until you get a 0. <br>
            You can view it as a flush operation.
