            The function cdClear() is eqivalent to cdCanvasClear(cdActiveCanvas()).
            <br>
            <br>
            This action is interpreted very differently by each driver. <br>
            Many drivers simply draw a rectangle with the current background color. <br>
            It is not necessary to call cdClear when the canvas has just been created, as at this moment 
            it is already clean (CD_WHITE), unless you set a different background colour. <br>
            Most file-based drivers do not implement this function.
