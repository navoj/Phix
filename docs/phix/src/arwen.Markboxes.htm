            Markboxes (my name for this class) are controls with a field that leaves a
            mark when it is clicked by the mouse. You can associate text with
            a markbox either at it's creation or at any other time using
            setText(). A CheckBox can have 2 states (on &amp; off) which
            toggle with each mouse click. A TriCheckBox has 3 states (on, off
            &amp; grayed). A RadioButton has 2 states (on &amp; off) but it's
            behaviour is influenced by any other sibling RadioButtons. As a
            RadioButton is clicked all the other ones will be cleared. this
            is the default behaviour from Windows. An application can
            determine a button's state by sending it a BM_GETCHECK or
            BM_GETSTATE message; the application can set a button's state by
            sending it a BM_SETCHECK or BM_SETSTATE message.
