            When MULTILINE=YES the Enter key will add a new line, and the Tab key will insert a Tab. 
            So the "DEFAULTENTER" button will not be processed when the element has the keyboard focus, also to change focus to the next element press <Ctrl>+<Tab>.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Windows, if you press a Ctrl+key combination that is not supported by the control, then a beep is sound.

            <br>
            When using UTF-8 strings in GTK be aware that all attributes are indexed by characters, NOT by byte index, because some characters in UTF-8 can use more than one byte. 
            This also applies to Windows if FORMATTING=YES depending on the Windows codepage (for example East Asian codepage where some characters take two bytes).
            <br>
            <br>
            Internal Drag&Drop support is enabled by default. But in Windows the internal Drag&Drop is enabled only if FORMATTING=YES. 
            In GTK the internal Drag&Drop can NOT be disabled, so it will conflict with the Drag & Drop attributes and callbacks.

            Here is a list of the common keys for all drivers. Other keys are available depending on the driver.
            <ul>

          CARET
         </td>
         <td>
            (non inheritable) Character position of the insertion point. Its format depends in MULTILINE=YES. The first position, lin or col, is "1".
            <br>
            <br>
            For multiple lines: a string with the "lin,col" format, where lin and col are integer numbers corresponding to the caret&rsquo;s position.
            <br>
            <br>
            For single line: a string in the "col" format, where col is an integer number corresponding to the caret&rsquo;s position.
            <br>
            <br>
            When lin is greater than the number of lines, the caret is placed at the last line. 
            When col is greater than the number of characters in the given line, the caret is placed after the last character of the line.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the caret is not visible the text is scrolled to make it visible.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Windows, if the element does not have the focus the returned value is the position of the first character of the current selection. 
            The caret is only displayed if the element has the keyboard focus, but its position can be changed even if not visible. 
            When changed it will also change the selection but the text will be scrolled only when it receives the focus.
