            Ready to use function that checks for pending write operations and flush them waiting until they are done or until the timeout provided by the user is reached.
            <br>
            <br>
            This function uses <a href="nopoll_conn_pending_write_bytes.htm">nopoll_conn_pending_write_bytes</a> and 
            <a href="nopoll_conn_complete_pending_write.htm">nopoll_conn_complete_pending_write</a> to check and complete pending write operations.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because writing pending bytes is a common operation, this function is provided as a ready to use function to call after a write operation (for example 
            <a href="nopoll_conn_send_text.htm">nopoll_conn_send_text</a>).
            <br>
            <br>
            conn: The connection where pending bytes must be written.<br>
            timeout: Timeout in microseconds to limit the flush operation.<br>
            previous_result: The number of bytes read before this call. <br>
            The value received on this function will be added to the result, checking first it contains a value higher than 0. <br>
            This is an option to clarify the interface. <br>
            If you don&rsquo;t have the value to be passed to this function at the time needed, just pass 0.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns: Bytes that were written. If no pending bytes must be written, the function returns 0. <br>
            The function returns bytes written or bytes written plus if previous_result is > 0.
