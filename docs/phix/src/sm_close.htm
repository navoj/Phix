            Once an application calls sm_close(), that memory is no longer available to that application, but does not mean that the memory 
            is no longer available to other applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each application must call sm_close() to close it&rsquo;s handle to the shared memory.<br>
            A block of shared memory will continue to exist until all handles to it have been closed.
