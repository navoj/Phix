            Set the global optional mutex handlers used by noPoll library to create, destroy, lock and unlock mutexes.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you set this handlers, the library will use these functions to secure sensitive code paths that must be protected while working with threads.
            <br>
            <br>
            If not provided, the library will work as usual without doing any locking.
            <br>
            <br>
            Note that, unlike the C version of this routine, this installs standard handlers, and there is no way to uninstall them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some applications, especially single-threaded ones, may be slightly faster without these routines, which is why they are not automatically installed. <br>
            There is, of course, no need to install these routines unless you or something else is calling <a href="create_thread.htm">create_thread</a>().
