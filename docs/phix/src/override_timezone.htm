            Unfortunately, there is no internationally agreed standard for timezone abbreviations that includes
            GMT/BST/etc. Time zone abbreviations are not necessarily unique, for example BST may refer to 
            British Summer Time or Bangladesh Standard Time. Other collisions include EST (Eastern/Egypt), 
            IST (Irish/India/Iran/Israel), and MST (Mountain/Myanmar).

            This routine allows you to replace any such clashes, or add new entries. The table cannot meaningfully 
            hold two versions of a timezone code, so instead the application must swap any clashes in and out as 
            required. Less importantly but still perhaps beneficial is the ability to extend the tables without 
            modifying the original source code (builtins\timedate.e).
            <br>
            <br>
            It is highly unlikely this routine can be used successfully without detailed reference to the inner
            workings of builtins\timedate.e and hence there is little point further documenting the parameters,
            nor are any examples likely to help. I am perfectly open to any extensions/alternatives to this 
            routine, or for example, adding "hook routines" at selected key points. If you think you can identify 
            the latter and that it would help, let me know.
