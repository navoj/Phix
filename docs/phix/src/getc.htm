         <td>File input using getc() is buffered, i.e. getc() does not actually
             go out to the disk for each character. Instead, a large block of
             characters will be read in at one time and returned to you one
             by one from a memory buffer.
          <br>
          <br>
             When getc() reads from the keyboard, it will not see any characters until
             the user presses Enter.
             Note that the user can type
             control-Z, which the operating system treats as "end of file".
             -1 will be returned.
          <br>
          <br>
            getc0() is a low-level equivalent of {} = getc(0), aka if getc(0) then end if, see builtins\puts1[h].e (not an autoinclude)
