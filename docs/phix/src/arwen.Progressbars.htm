      <div id="mainSection">
       <br>
            This is similar to a TrackBar or ScrollBar but does not generate
            WM_HSCROLL or WM_VSCROLL messages. You can use getPos()&amp;
            setPos() to access the position of the leading edge of a
            ProgressBar and setScrollInfo() to access other settings as
            explained above. ProgressBars are, by default, horizontal but
            using PBS_VERTICAL in the style parameter on creation will
            produce a vertical bar. ProgressBars also have a default output
            of discrete graphic blocks but this can be changed by including
            PBS_SMOOTH in the style parameter on creation. To advance the
            leading edge by another iteration you can call makeProgress().
            Please note that when using this routine once the leading edge
            reaches the end then the very next call will reset the edge back
            to the beginning where it will start progressing again. I think
            there is some potential for incorrect behaviour here. Please note
            that all the parameter values must be in the range 0 to 65535.
