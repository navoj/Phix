         Phix processes your source file in one pass, starting at the first
         line and proceeding through to the last line. When a procedure or function
         definition is encountered, the routine is checked for syntax and converted
         into an internal form, but no execution takes place. When a statement that
         is outside of any routine is encountered, it is checked for syntax,
         converted into an internal form and then immediately executed.
         A common practice is to immediately initialize a global variable, just
         after its declaration. If your
        <b>.ex</b> file contains only
         routine definitions, but no immediate execution statements, then nothing will
         happen when you try to run it (other than syntax checking). You need to have
         an immediate statement to call your main routine (see the
        <a href="example.htm">Example Program</a>).
         It is quite possible to have a source file with nothing but
         immediate statements, for example you might want to use phix as a
         simple calculator, typing in just one
        <a href="print.htm">print</a>
         (or
        <a href="qu.htm">?</a>) statement into a file, and then executing it.
       <br>
       <br>
         As we have seen, you can use any phix
        <a href="statements.htm">statement</a>, including
        <a href="for.htm">for-loops</a>,
        <a href="while.htm">while-loops</a>,
        <a href="if.htm">if</a> statements etc. (but not
        <a href="return.htm">return</a>), at the top level i.e.
        <b>
         <i>outside</i>
        </b> of any
        <a href="functions.htm"></a> or
        <a href="procedures.htm">procedure</a>.
         In addition, the following special statements may
        <font color="#020202">
         <b>
          <i>only</i>
         </b>
        </font> appear at the top level:
        <ul>
         <li> include
         </li>
         <li> with / without
         </li>
         <li> format
         </li>
        </ul>
