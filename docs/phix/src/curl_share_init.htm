            This function returns a CURLSH (atom) handle to be used as input to all the other share-functions, 
            sometimes referred to as a share handle in some places in the documentation. <br>
            This init call MUST have a corresponding call to <a href="curl_share_cleanup.htm">curl_share_cleanup</a> 
            when all operations using the share are complete.
            <br>
            <br>
            This share handle is what you pass to curl using the <a href="CURLoption.htm#CURLOPT_SHARE">CURLOPT_SHARE</a> option 
            with <a href="curl_easy_setopt.htm">curl_easy_setopt</a>, to make that specific curl handle use the data in this share.
            <br>
            <br>
            Returns a share handle. <br>
            A fatal error occurs if something goes wrong. <br>
            Legacy code may check for NULL, but that is no longer necessary and the equivalent processing should instead be performed 
            via <a href="try.htm">exception handling</a>, if at all - in general phix takes the perhaps rather stern view that a brutal 
            crash both gives clues and forces a fix, whereas quietly ignoring errors (certainly as opposed to handling them properly)
            can <i>only</i> lead to frustration, irritation, and annoyance.
