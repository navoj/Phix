            The gluLookAt function defines a viewing transformation.
            <br>
            <br>
            eye: The position of the eye point, as {x,y,z}.<br>
            center: The position of the reference point, as {x,y,z}.<br>
            up: The direction of the up vector, as {x,y,z}.
         </td>

          <b>Remarks</b>
         </td>
         <td>
            The gluLookAt function creates a viewing matrix derived from an eye point, a reference point indicating the center of the scene, and an up vector. <br>
            The matrix maps the reference point to the negative z-axis and the eye point to the origin, so that when you use a typical projection matrix, 
            the center of the scene maps to the center of the viewport. <br>
            Similarly, the direction described by the up vector projected onto the viewing plane is mapped to the positive y-axis so that it points upward in the viewport. <br>
            The up vector must not be parallel to the line of sight from the eye to the reference point.
            <br>
            <br>
            The matrix generated by gluLookAt postmultiplies the current matrix.
