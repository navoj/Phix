            These are created in the usual way. Child windows are created when pID
            refers to an already existing window (NB: This is not the same as
            specifying WS_CHILD in the style). All the standard &amp;
            extended class styles are available to the user but Common Dialog
            windows will have Windows-defined parameters. By specifying
            WS_HSCROLL and/or WS_VSCROLL in the style parameter the window
            will be created with builtin scroll bar/s. In this situation the
            window's handler routine will then be sent any scroll messages
            relating to those scroll bars. ARWEN has provision for managing
            an independent set of scroll bars to replace the poorly
            performing built-in scroll bars.
