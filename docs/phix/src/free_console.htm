            Phix will create a console text window for your program the first time that your program prints something to the
            screen, reads something from the keyboard, or in some way needs a console (similar to a DOS-prompt window). <br>
            On Windows this window will automatically disappear when your program terminates, but you can call free_console() 
            to make it disappear sooner. <br>
            On Linux, the text mode console is always there, but an xterm window will disappear after phix issues a 
            "Press Enter" prompt at the end of execution.
          <br>
          <br>
            On Linux, free_console() will set the terminal parameters back to normal, undoing the effect
            that curses has on the screen.
          <br>
          <br>
            In a Linux xterm window, a call to free_console(), without any
            further printing to the screen or reading from the keyboard, will eliminate
            the "Press Enter" prompt that phix normally issues at the end of execution.
          <br>
          <br>
            After freeing the console window, you can create a new console
             window by printing something to the screen, or simply calling
             clear_screen(),
           <a href="position.htm">position</a>() or any
             other routine that needs a console.
          <br>
          <br>
            When you use the
           <font color="#030303">
            <b>trace</b>
           </font> facility,
             or when your program has an error, phix automatically creates a console window
             to display trace information, error messages etc.
          <br>
          <br>
            There is a Windows API routine, FreeConsole() that does something
             similar to free_console(). You should use free_console(),
             because it lets the interpreter know that there is no longer
             a console.
