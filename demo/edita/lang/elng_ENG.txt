Note that undocumented combinations are not necessarily inoperative, for example 
the current code to handle F1 does not check whether Shift is depressed.

*F5 (alone) checks the project database before running the program. If the current file is included 
by another file, then it attempts to execute that file (repeating the inclusion test). If the file 
is included by more than one other file, the Ctrl F5 window is shown. Ctrl+Shift F5 runs the current 
file without checking the include details. Include information is gathered/saved as part of background 
processing and/or when Ctrl Q or F1 is pressed while editing the parent file.

Backspace is the large <--- key above return.  The CSM key is the windows button which usually behaves 
as right mouse click (it usually has a menu with a mouse pointer on it).
Items above in [square brackets] indicate standard windows behaviour.

Find keys summary:
=================
   key             finds what             target
 Ctrl F          <opens dialog>         selected text or previous search target.
 F3              Next occurence         previous search target.
 Shift+F3        Previous occurence     previous search target.
 Ctrl+F3         First occurence        selected text or previous search target.
 Ctrl+Shift+F3   Next occurence         selected text or previous search target.

   TIP: If the control key is not pressed the current text selection is ignored
         (unless invoking a menu entry which indicates a Ctrl key shortcut).

Menu keys:
==========

 Select entries from the menu using Alt F, E, P, T, M, O, or H.
 Alt space opens the system menu. Alt F4 closes the application.

 Note: About ALT and Windows menus
 Press the Alt key and release it. You should notice a depressed button effect around
 "File" on the menu bar signifying the menu now has "focus" rather than the edit area.
 This is a standard Windows behaviour. Some keystrokes (especially the function keys)
 will be ignored. Press Alt again (or esc) to return focus to the edit area.
 A similar behaviour occurs with F10 (again, this is standard windows behaviour)

This may not be of much use if only a few files are open, but when there are

session only). Files may also be sorted by filename, extension, directory, 
file size, or date last modified, by clicking on the column heading or pressing 
Alt 1..6, and/or a filter applied to the filename or directory.

It is possible to remove the tabbar completely (via Options/Display) and use
this function to switch between files.

 -- File Extensions Window. See eafext.ew
-----------------------------------------
"_FXHELP" = """
Select an existing entry from the list or click on New. There is no way to change the 
extension field value on an existing record since it is used as a primary key on the 
database, hence it is disabled in Edit mode, and instead a new record must be created 
and the incorrect one deleted.

When adding a New entry, if the extension entered at any point matches an existing entry, 
the label to the left turns red as a minor warning. Tabbing to another field when in this 
state or clicking on a button drops into Edit mode, with the extension field disabled and 
the Run With and Tab Colour restored from the existing record.

For the Run With field, use the browse button to search for the command or enter a path
and filename string, eg C:\Euphoria\bin\exw.exe plus any command line switches required.
Alternatively enter "=xxx" to treat this file extension the same as an existing one, eg 
to run .exu files the same as .exw files. This notation does not apply to Tab Colours.
Suppose I want to run the sources of Edita on a different interpreter. I could assign 
the new interpreter to say e31, and then either create a file edita.e31 which is just 
"include edita.exw", or alternatively I can pick e31 from the Ctrl F5 Parameterised 
Run Window, and set the "Always use specified extension" to enforce it for that source.
Paths containing spaces may need to be wrapped in quotation marks. The filename will be
substituted for "%s" if found, otherwise it is appended at the end.

The special value of "open" causes a plain shellExecute to be used, effectively the 
same as double clicking on a file with that extension in Explorer.

The Tab Colour field is #BBGGRR. When editing this field, as soon as it contains a '#'
followed by exactly six valid hex digits, the new colour is immediately applied to all
existing filetabs with that extension. Cancel will reverse this effect.
Obviously it can look pretty garish with harsh bright colours such as Red or Yellow;
softer pastel colours work better."""

a command string such as

C:\Euphoria\bin\exwc.exe "C:\Program Files\Edita\eacons.exw" %08x C:\Euphoria\bin\exwc.exe "%s"

Must be manually setup via Options/File Extensions, and capture console output occurs 
if the specified command contains eacons.exw and %08x. The trailing "%s" should be 
considered mandatory to avoid problems with quotation marks. In the above the first/
left hand exwc is running eacons.exw, and should almost always be left as exwc, it is 
the second/right hand one that might need to be changed.

Always use specified command allows the treatment of a specific file to be overriden. 
The exact command string as shown is saved for future use. You can also enter eg
"=b55" which causes the file to be treated as if the extension were b55, and set the 
meaning of/command for b55 in Options/File Extensions. Obviously, "b55" is a made up
thing, it could stand for Borland 5.5, or something else. A similar but more general 
option is allowed in Options/File Extensions, eg "=exw" on the "exu" record causes 
all .exu files to be treated as .exw files when F5 is pressed."""
