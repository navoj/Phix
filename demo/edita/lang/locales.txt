Edita language files.
====================

As of 0.3.0, Edita now uses the 3-character locale identifier provided by Windows,
eg "ENG" for British English, "ENU" for American English.

elng_ENG.txt is the master/template for all new translation files.
elng_ENU.txt begins with "elng_ENG.txt" to continue with that file, and likewise 
eg ESO (Columbian Spanish) could be mapped to ESP (Traditional Spanish) if desired.

Currently distrubuted language files include:
lang\elng_DEU.txt  - German
lang\elng_ENA.txt  - stub English(Australia) -> English(UK)
lang\elng_ENC.txt  - stub English(Canada) -> English(UK)
lang\elng_ENG.txt  - English(UK) [master file]
lang\elng_ENI.txt  - stub English(Ireland) -> English(UK)
lang\elng_ENU.txt  - stub English(USA) -> English(UK)
lang\elng_ENZ.txt  - stub English(NZ) -> English(UK)
lang\elng_ESN.txt  - Spanish (International) - incomplete
lang\elng_ESO.txt  - Spanish (Columbian)
lang\elng_FIN.txt  - Finnish
lang\elng_FRA.txt  - French
lang\elng_ITA.txt  - Italian
lang\elng_NLD.txt  - Dutch
lang\elng_PTG.txt  - Portugese - incomplete

After an error message at startup, select one of:
1) For "No translation for" messages, an elng_XXX.txt file exists, use Tools/
    Translation Assistant to find/edit missing entires [unless XXX=ENG, in which
    case it is a bug and should be reported as such], or
2) Use Translation Assistant to copy elng_ENG.txt (to the name given in the 
    message, which it should default to) and then edit as desired, or
3) Manually copy a "stub" such as elng_ENU.txt (ditto) and edit (if needed) to 
    link to the most appropriate full file. Note only one "hop" is allowed.
4) If elng_ENG.txt is missing, maybe (assuming it is not the windows installer
    at fault) you manually unpacked the software incorrectly. Try again, looking 
    for "Keep directory stucture" or a similar unchecked box or missing command 
    line option.

If you send me a modified elng_XXX.txt file, I will incorporate it in future
releases.
