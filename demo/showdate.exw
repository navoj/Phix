--  NEW: much easier way to do the same thing:
--
include builtins\timedate.e
    puts(1,format_timedate(date(),"Dddd Mmmm dd, yyyy 'at' h:m:spm, 'day' doy 'of the year'\n"))

-- ?format_timedate(date()) -- eg "5:37pm Sunday October 23rd, 2016"

if getc(0) then end if

-- aside: the earlier printf() opens a new console, which takes around a 20th of
--        a second, and hence the second line will be +1sec about 1 in 20 times.
