Some further steps are required to install IUP, see demo/pGUI/lnx/installation.txt
One day these notes will be part of the official documentation.

Installation of IUP on Linux
============================
You may have luck with apt-get or whatever, it may even be pre-installed.

Otherwise, goto http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/ and download the cd, im, and iup binaries.
Pick a version and then select "Linux Libaries". The README.linux.md (displayed) is clearly 4 years
or so out of date, but you should get the idea, and also know more about your system that I do.
I suspect the key thing to look for (after 32/64 bit, obvs) is the closest kernel version number.
The steps below are taken from the versions shown, check the LINSTALL files just in case.

mkdir cd
cd cd
tar -xpvzf ../cd-5.11_Linux32_lib.tar.gz
sudo ./install
cd ..

mkdir im
cd im
tar -xpvzf ../im-3.12_Linux32_lib.tar.gz
sudo ./install
cd ..

mkdir iup
cd iup
tar -xpvzf ../iup-3.21_Linux32_lib.tar.gz
sudo ./install
cd ..

For 64-bit, replace "Linux32_lib" with "Linux32_64_lib".

It has been reported that running the uninstall script and re-running install has helped, no idea why.

opengl??

Help Files:
==========
You can of course download a chm viewer such as ChmSee or KchmViewer to open docs/phix/phix.chm. Alternatively,
create the directory docs/phix/html, run docs/phix/makephix.exw, copy phix.htm into the html folder and edit it 
to remove the ten or so references to the html subfolder, and lastly copy images, Combined.css, Common.js, and 
header_01/2.jpg into the html folder. You should then be able to view the help properly in your browser. 
Feel free to enhance makephix.exw to clear up any niggles.

I noticed some of the Technicalia dropdowns were squidged in a way they are not on Windows, and of course 
there is no search function like the one in the chm file, which you do get in KchmViewer by not ChmSee.


some older notes re Help:
=========================
I installed several chm viewers, of coure it will depend on personal perferences, but this is what I found:
None of them handle javascript, so the document tree (middle column on Windows) just gets in the way - maybe
makephix.exw can be tweaked to minimise that problem.

ChmSee
======
The main page is spot-on.
Images on other pages are missing (eg IupFrame).
No way to open up technicalia (eg abort).
Sadly there is no search.
Development stopped 08/2013. I was testing 1.3.0 (the latest for ubuntu) whereas 2.0.2 exists...

KchmViewer
==========
The main page is not as good as ChmSee.
Oddly, IupFrame showed the image (whereas the main page did not).
Technicalia permanently displayed.
Has a perfectly good search function.
Development appears active. I was testing 5.3 whereas 7.7 exists...

xCHM
====
Very similar to KchmViever.
Development stopped in 2013. I was testing 1.20 whereas 1.23 exists.

FBReader
========
(aka E_Reader) Not really suitable (no contents, no index, and a next/prev-only search).

Lastly, the Python script chm2pdf seemed to work fairly well, though there were some errors that I ignored.

Of course you can view individual pages from docs/phix/src in any web browser, or maybe tweak makephix.exw
to massage them into better html (and ignore/disable the attempts to create a chm file [DONE]).
